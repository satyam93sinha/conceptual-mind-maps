# Systems Design for Interviews â€“ Mind Map

## 1. Networks and Protocols
  - **Networks**: Connections
  - **Protocols**: rules that govern something, official procedure.
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**
  - Numeric label(Protocol) assigned to devices over Internet for communication.
  - Messages sent in **packets**
    - **Definition of Packets**
      - small chunk of information (2^16 bytes)
    - **Components**
      - headers (source/destination IP addresses)
      - data (message/information)
  - **IPv4** vs. **IPv6** (to handle IP exhaustion).
  - **Demerits (Corrupted Data)**
    - Loss or dropped packets
    - Unordered packet delivery

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
  - Built on top of IP to ensure reliable, ordered packet delivery.
  - Uses **handshakes** to establish and close connections.
  - **Message Components**
    - IP Header: From/To addresses
    - TCP Header: Ordering of packets, no. of packets etc
    - Data: Information

- **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
  - Client requests, Server responds
  - Protocol for web communication using a **request-response model**.
  - Supports **verbs** like GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH/PUT, TRACE, OPTIONS, HEAD

## 2. Storage, Latency, and Throughput
- **Storage Types**
  - **Memory (RAM):** Fast but volatile(data lost in Power OFF), costly.
  - **Disk Storage:** Persistent but slower (used for databases).

- **Latency**
  - Time taken (duration) for an operation (e.g., request-response cycle, searching in dict than array).
  - Lower latency means faster response time.
  - Affected by Client-Server distance

- **Throughput**
  - Amount of data processed in a given time (e.g., Mbps or requests/second). Max capacity of a system.
  - Higher throughput means better scalability improving performance.
  - System is limited by its lowest throughput (bottleneck)

---

## 3. System Availability
- **High Availability (HA)**
  - Achieved by reducing **single points of failure** and adding redundancy.
  - Fault-tolerant system: robust to handle failures in the networks, databases, servers etc.

- **SLAs (Service Level Agreements)**
  - Commitments to uptime (e.g., 99.99% availability).
  - 99.9% uptime means 8.77 hours of DOWNTIME per year
  - 99.99% uptime means 52.6 mins DOWNTIME per year
  - 99.999% uptime means approx 5 mins DOWNTIME per year

- **Designing HA Systems**
  - Use **replication** and **load balancing** to ensure resilience.
  - Avoid Single Point of Failures, introduce redundancy.

---

## 4. Caching and CDNs
- **Caching**  
  - Stores frequently used data for fast access (reduces latency).
  - Reduces Database overload
  - Reduces Network calls to Database
  - Fast access compared to Disk/Database
  - Use cache miss and eviction strategies according to use-case

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
  - Distribute content across global servers to reduce load and latency.
  - Acts as mini-servers to quickly serve requests from a closer geographical location.

---

## 5. Proxies
- **Forward Proxy**
  - Acts on behalf of a client (e.g., VPNs).
  - Hides client's IP, geographical location.

- **Reverse Proxy**
  - Works on behalf of a server, often handling **load balancing** and **security**.
  - Hides backend servers from public access, (internal servers) can have private IPs and no encryption etc for optimisation and free flow.

---

## 6. Load Balancing
- **Algorithms**  
  - Round-robin, Least connections, Load Based, Mixed Bag, Path or Service based, IP-hash, Weighted Round-robin, Server statuses, Alphabetic partition.
- **Use Case:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.
- Mainly introduced to regulate n/w calls or communications like client-load balancer-backend, backend-load balancer-database, backend-load balancer-caches etc.
- Can act as rate limiter, reverse proxy server too.
- Ensure Load Balancers redundancy, fail-over, fail-back to better scalability and reduce fault-tolerance.

## 7. Hashing
- **Hashing:** Puts universe of keys to fixed size bags.
- Collision Handling: Chaining, Open Addressing: Linear, Quadratic and Double Hashing/Probing.
- **Cons:**
  - server fails, traffic still gets routed to it.
  - High data redistribution with any change in node count, wastes previous caches.
  - No ring structure; applies hashes directly to data.

## 8. Consistent Hashing
- Ring structure; server is hashed and placed at multiple locations for uniform distribution/routing of requests.
- Servers at different locations in a ring can be called nodes
- A server/node fails, requests are redirected to the next node in loop.
- To achieve optimum uniformity in load distribution, hashed requests can be routed to hashed-server/node
- Introduced to backend-servers and caches.
- Addition or removal of servers has least impact on the system.

## 9. Databases
- **Relational**
  - Strictly enforced relationships like rows and columns.
  - Schema: Classic relational database or formalized entity structure.
  - Data being inserted should conform to the predefined schema.
  - SQL: Structured Query Language, a language designed to interact with structured (relational) database.
  - Databases itself manages these queries(executes them) and returns matching results.
  - Follows ACID property
    - **Atomicity:** One operation fails, entire transaction fails. All or nothing.
    - **Consistency:** Every read operation receives the most recent write operation result. Full-synchronisation.
    - **Isolation:** you can "concurrently" (at the same time) run multiple transactions on a database, but the database will end up with a state that looks as though each operation had been run serially ( in a sequence, like a queue of operations).
    - **Durability:** data stored in DB is persistent (ROM or disk), not in-memory (RAM).
- **Non-relational**
  - Less rigid, more flexible structure like key-value pairs.
  - Follows BASE
    - **Basically Available:** system guarantess availability.
    - **Soft State:** DB/table state may change over time, even without input.
    - **Eventual Consistency:** states that the system will become consistent over a (very short) period of time unless other inputs are received.
  - At core, DB holds data in a hash-table-like structure (thus, extremely fast, simple and easy to use).
  - Perfect for use-cases like caching, environment variables, configuration files and session state etc.
  - Memcached (in-memory), DynamoDB (persistent)
