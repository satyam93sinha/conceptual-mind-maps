# Systems Design for Interviews â€“ Mind Map

## 1. Networks and Protocols
  - **Networks**: Connections
  - **Protocols**: rules that govern something, official procedure.
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**
  - Numeric label(Protocol) assigned to devices over Internet for communication.
  - Messages sent in **packets**
    - **Definition of Packets**
      - small chunk of information (2^16 bytes)
    - **Components**
      - headers (source/destination IP addresses)
      - data (message/information)
  - **IPv4** vs. **IPv6** (to handle IP exhaustion).
  - **Demerits (Corrupted Data)**
    - Loss or dropped packets
    - Unordered packet delivery

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
  - Built on top of IP to ensure reliable, ordered packet delivery.
  - Uses **handshakes** to establish and close connections.
  - **Message Components**
    - IP Header: From/To addresses
    - TCP Header: Ordering of packets, no. of packets etc
    - Data: Information

- **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
  - Client requests, Server responds
  - Protocol for web communication using a **request-response model**.
  - Supports **verbs** like GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH/PUT, TRACE, OPTIONS, HEAD

## 2. Storage, Latency, and Throughput
- **Storage Types**
  - **Memory (RAM):** Fast but volatile(data lost in Power OFF), costly.
  - **Disk Storage:** Persistent but slower (used for databases).

- **Latency**
  - Time taken (duration) for an operation (e.g., request-response cycle, searching in dict than array).
  - Lower latency means faster response time.
  - Affected by Client-Server distance

- **Throughput**
  - Amount of data processed in a given time (e.g., Mbps or requests/second). Max capacity of a system.
  - Higher throughput means better scalability improving performance.
  - System is limited by its lowest throughput (bottleneck)

---

## 3. System Availability
- **High Availability (HA)**
  - Achieved by reducing **single points of failure** and adding redundancy.
  - Fault-tolerant system: robust to handle failures in the networks, databases, servers etc.

- **SLAs (Service Level Agreements)**
  - Commitments to uptime (e.g., 99.99% availability).
  - 99.9% uptime means 8.77 hours of DOWNTIME per year
  - 99.99% uptime means 52.6 mins DOWNTIME per year
  - 99.999% uptime means approx 5 mins DOWNTIME per year

- **Designing HA Systems**
  - Use **replication** and **load balancing** to ensure resilience.
  - Avoid Single Point of Failures, introduce redundancy.

---

## 4. Caching and CDNs
- **Caching**  
  - Stores frequently used data for fast access (reduces latency).
  - Data retrieval from cache is faster than from the disk/database.
  - Backend's computationally intensive and time consuming work could be reduced through caching.
  - Cache data should be in sync with the Database
  - Reduce and Handle Cache misses
  - Data Eviction like LRU, LFU, LIFO, FIFO

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
  - Distribute content across global servers to reduce load and latency.

---

## 5. Proxies
- **Forward Proxy**
  - Acts on behalf of a client (e.g., VPNs).

- **Reverse Proxy**
  - Works on behalf of a server, often handling **load balancing** and **security**.
  - Hides backend servers from public access, can have private IPs and no encryption etc for optimisation and free flow.

---

## 6. Load Balancing
- **Algorithms**  
  - Round-robin, Least connections, Load Based, Mixed Bag, Path or Service based, IP-hash, Weighted Round-robin, Server statuses, Alphabetic partition.
- **Use Case:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.
- Can be introduced at multpile points like Backend Server, Databases, Caches.
- Can limit number of requests per minute, per user etc to avoid DOS/DDOS attacks.
- Ensure Load Balancers redundancy, fail-over, fail-back to better scalability and reduce fault-tolerance.
