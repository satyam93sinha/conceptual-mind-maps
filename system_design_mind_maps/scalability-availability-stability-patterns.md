# Mind Map: Scalability, Availability, and Stability Patterns

## 1. Overview
   - **Purpose**: Enable systems to handle increased load, ensure reliability, and recover from failures.
   - **Key Characteristics**:
     - Scalability
     - Availability
     - Stability
   - **Domains of Use**: E-commerce, cloud platforms, large-scale distributed systems.

---

## 2. Scalability Patterns
### 2.1 Vertical Scaling
   - Add resources to a single node (e.g., CPU, RAM).
   - **Advantages**: Simplicity, minimal software changes.
   - **Disadvantages**: Cost, single point of failure.

### 2.2 Horizontal Scaling
   - Add more nodes to a system (e.g., servers).
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Sharding**: Partition data across multiple databases.
     - **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across servers.
   - **Advantages**: High availability, cost-efficient scaling.
   - **Disadvantages**: Increased complexity.

### 2.3 Auto-Scaling
   - Automatically add/remove resources based on demand.
   - **Examples**: AWS Auto Scaling, Google Cloud Autoscaler.

---

## 3. Availability Patterns
### 3.1 Redundancy
   - Replicate resources to ensure no single point of failure.
   - **Examples**:
     - Database Replication.
     - Traffic Manager with failover mechanisms.

### 3.2 Load Balancers
   - Distribute traffic across servers to improve availability.
   - **Examples**: HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

### 3.3 Failover Mechanisms
   - Redirect traffic to backup systems during failures.
   - **Examples**:
     - Primary-secondary database replication.
     - Traffic failover for cloud-based apps.

## 4. Stability Patterns
### 4.1 Circuit Breaker
   - Prevents cascading failures by isolating faulty services.
   - **Use Case**: Microservices.

### 4.2 Bulkheads
   - Isolate critical components to limit the impact of failures.
   - **Example**: Separate pools for different requests.

### 4.3 Retry and Timeout
   - Retry transient errors with limits to prevent overload.
   - **Timeouts**: Avoid indefinitely waiting for responses.

### 4.4 Compensation Patterns
   - Handle errors in distributed systems by undoing operations.
   - **Example**: Financial transactions using idempotency.

---

## 5. Combined Patterns and Trade-offs
### 5.1 CAP Theorem
   - Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance (choose two).
   - **Trade-offs**:
     - CP systems (e.g., RDBMS): Strong consistency.
     - AP systems (e.g., NoSQL): High availability.

### 5.2 Eventual Consistency
   - Ensure updates propagate eventually in distributed systems.
   - **Use Case**: DNS, social media feeds.

### 5.3 Materialized Views
   - Precomputed results to optimize read operations.
   - **Use Case**: Analytics.

---

## 6. Implementation Examples
### 6.1 E-commerce Systems
   - **Scalability**: Sharding, auto-scaling.
   - **Availability**: Redundancy in payment gateways.
   - **Stability**: Circuit breaker for inventory services.

### 6.2 Streaming Platforms
   - **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling of video delivery.
   - **Availability**: Geo-replication of content.
   - **Stability**: Bulkhead pattern for recommendation engines.

## 7. Advantages and Disadvantages
### 7.1 Advantages
   - Improved user experience.
   - Better fault tolerance.
   - Optimized resource usage.

### 7.2 Disadvantages
   - Increased system complexity.
   - Higher operational costs.
   - Trade-offs between performance and consistency.
